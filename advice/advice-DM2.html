			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>I find that Skillcrush tends to make assumptions that you'd know stuff that beginners don't know.  For example, when the said to make a folder in the directory, they didn't say where.  As it turns out, you are not supposed to put it in an existing repository.  Not knowing, I did that.  Now I am redoing everything to get it right.</p>
